    <h6>Solar electric really covers solar photovoltaic.</h6>
    <br>
    <p>Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available, and the u.s. Photovoltaic solar energy or thermal solar energy are two technologies to take advantage of this energy when it reaches earth. 30% of that is reflected back to space. Solar energy is something that we have really been looking into in recent years, if for no other reason than to try and find a better way to deal with getting energy without hurting the environment. The most common form of solar energy is harnessed by solar panels, or photovoltaic cells. Solar energy facts in a nutshell. When the sun&#039;s energy is captured through photosynthesis; Solar energy is the radiant energy produced by the sun. To get technical, solar energy is the radiant energy that the sun produces. Light from the sun comes as ultraviolet, visible and infra red rays. Solar energy is energy generated by the sun. It&#039;s renewable and for all intents and purposes an endless source of power. Although some incoming sunlight is reflected by earth&#039;s atmosphere and surface, most is absorbed by the surface, which is warmed.</p>
    <p><u>It is a renewable energy that is gaining momentum in the parts of the world because it is deemed as an effective alternative to the. It is also important to note that all forms of energy. Solar energy is energy generated by the sun. Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy. This video gives a simple but compelling introduction to solar energy. Did you know that all of the energy we use comes from the sun,?</u></p>
