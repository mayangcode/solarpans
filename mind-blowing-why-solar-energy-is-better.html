    <h6>The environmental advantages are the main.</h6>
    <br>
    <p>A renewable and sustainable alternative energy for a brighter future. The energy can be used directly to heat, and light homes or it can be. The first pv silicon cell capable of converting the sun&#039;s energy into power that could run electrical equipment was introduced in 1954, and by 1983, worldwide pv production exceeded 21 megawatts. The first photocell, like those now used in solar batteries, was invented more than 130 years ago. Solar energy is a sustainable energy source, has a low environmental impact, and promotes energy independence. The most commonly known fact about solar energy is that it represents a clean, green. You&#039;ve heard that solar energy is good for the environment, but have you ever wondered why or how? Solar energy is the technology used to harness the sun&#039;s energy and make it useable. Compared to solar panels, wind turbines release less co2 to the atmosphere, consume less energy, and produce more energy overall. As technology supersedes the mundane tasks that we humans undergo every single day, everything is accessible with a touch of a button, single swipe on your device or even by simple voice commands. Solar energy is considered to be the best option for the people and modern industries as it belongs to the renewable category. Solar power is by far the leading renewable energy source globally, but just in case you weren&#039;t sure about that, here are some of the reasons why we believe solar will power the future. The realization that solar energy is far superior and applicable than we might have ever thought, has led many to ask the very simple question;</p>
    <p><u>On the other hand, it is limited by how long the sun is out, may cause a scarcity of materials. The history of photovoltaic solar power began with scientific experimentation during the late 1800s. Solar power is the key to a clean energy future. Solar energy is the technology used to harness the sun&#039;s energy and make it useable. Learn about the advantages of solar energy as our natural by definition, solar energy is energy derived from the sun. A renewable and sustainable alternative energy for a brighter future.</u></p>
