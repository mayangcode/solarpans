Solar energy is basically the energy harnessed from the sun&#039;s radiation. But they&#039;re growing quickly and can play a key role in tackling climate change. 1,621 solar energy 2017 wattes products are offered for sale by suppliers on alibaba.com, of which you can also choose from commercial solar energy 2017 wattes. As of 2011, the technology produced less than one tenth of one percent of global energy demand. It can be captured and used in several ways, and as a renewable energy source, is an important part of our clean energy future. It has been used for thousands of years in many different ways by people all over the world. Solar energy is the energy that is produced by the sun in the form of heat and light. First, expanding the solar industry dramatically from its relatively tiny current scale may produce changes we do not pretend to be able to foresee today. The oldest uses of solar energy is for heating, cooking, and drying. Solar energy, the official journal of the international solar energy society®, is devoted exclusively to the science and technology of renewable energy, sustainability and the environment. According to the national renewable energy laboratory , more energy from the sun falls. Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. Solar energy not only produces clean, reliable power for customers, but also provides cost savings, community investment, and economic development opportunities throughout.
