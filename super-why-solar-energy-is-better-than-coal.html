    <h6>Answer:because solar energy is renewable in nature explanation:it will not exhaust with human use but coal will exhaust with rapid human use.</h6>
    <br>
    <p>But solar only works during the daytime when the clouds are not. A revolutionary bladeless turbine enables new solar pods to produce solar power at a lower cost than coal, and free of emissions. As of 2011, the technology produced less than one tenth of one percent the heat is then used to boil water to drive a steam turbine that generates electricity in much the same fashion as coal and nuclear power plants. Coal, besides a prime source of industrial energy is also a raw material. It&#039;s just that we heavily subsidize coal and oil. The first point is the very basic fact that new wind power and/or solar power plants are typically cheaper than new coal, natural gas, or nuclear power plants — even without any governmental support for solar or. Solar energy is the energy that is produced by the sun in the form of heat and light. Coal, including lignite even today accounts for 60% of the country&#039;s commercial some of the advantages of solar energy which makes it all the more suitable for india are as follows: Wind turbines and solar panels are an increasingly common sight. Natural gas is mostly methane, so that it has a better hydrogen to carbon ratio overall than coal. Answer:because solar energy is renewable in nature explanation:it will not exhaust with human use but coal will exhaust with rapid human use. Solar photovoltaics and wind energy were already cheaper than electricity from about 60% of coal stations, including about 70 renewable energy in south korea was expected to be cheaper than existing coal within two years. Solar energy panel for home, domestic use pros cons.</p>
    <p><u>• this is an inexhaustible source of energy and. Solar energy is a sustainable energy source, has a low environmental impact, and promotes energy independence. The impact can be seen in the data. Solar energy produced by international automated systems, inc. Is now a practical alternative to coal. • this is an inexhaustible source of energy and.</u></p>
