              <p><strong>Lovely Solar Energy Usage</strong>. Once the solar energy has been converted from dc to ac electricity, it runs through your electrical panel and is distributed within the home to power your appliances. Solar energy is one of the major resources mankind is turning to, for renewable power. See category:photovoltaics for many more specific articles on photovoltaics. As of 2011, the technology produced less than one tenth of one percent of global energy demand. Can be expensive when you install solar panels. Every second, more than 4 million metric tons of hydrogen is converted into helium.</p>
