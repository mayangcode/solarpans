    <h6>Solar energy is a sustainable energy source, has a low environmental impact, and promotes energy independence.</h6>
    <br>
    <p>The cost of your solar panels depends on the type of solar system and its size. While the use of solar energy has been growing exponentially in the last twenty years, the prices of pv cells have been dropping. The effective rate for solar power spread across the life of a system is $0.06/kwh. A kilowatt is 1,000 watts, so when you see the cost per watt of $2.50 to $3.50, multiply this number by 1,000 to get the cost per kilowatt. It has caused the cost of solar energy to artificially rise, and has driven business. Residential solar systems are expensive. A typical residential solar pv panel system in the u.s. The clean energy states alliance released a guide to help homeowners understand their. Our solar calculator takes a few key pieces of information (your location and current energy consumption) and estimates what size system you. Our experts have put insightful cost guides together for you. Use our solar calculator to determine how much your system may cost. (2) solar is by far the largest energy resource available on earth—renewable or otherwise. Thanks to advancing technology, the solar panel cost for your home keeps going down.</p>
    <p><u>Learn about factors affecting costs of residential solar panel installation, roi, and more. Before you make the leap, learn how your electric bill. An analysis of the cost of solar panels in alberta, bc, sk and nwt. Use our solar calculator to determine how much your system may cost. Solar energy is a natural source of energy that comes directly from the sun. Taking into account the 20 years system life expectancy and the interest cost, the payback period would be too long.</u></p>
