Although touching the panels is fine, it should never be done unsupervised because the panels can get warm to the touch in the direct sunlight, similar to touching. Solar technologies can harness this energy for a variety of uses, including generating electricity, providing light or a comfortable interior solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy. Solar energy is basically the energy harnessed from the sun&#039;s radiation. Solar energy is playing a pivotal role in compensating the electrical energy as there is short fall in this engergy due to more demand and decline trends of conventional source of energies exhaustion of fuels like coal, petroleum, natural gases and constant of environmental and climatic changes to cope up. Active solar − active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy.</p>
