The first pv silicon cell capable of converting the sun&#039;s energy into power that could run electrical equipment was introduced in 1954, and by 1983, worldwide pv production exceeded 21 megawatts. The potential environmental impacts associated with solar power depend on the technology, which includes two broad categories: It is basically a modern technique to generate in near future, you will found that solar energy is less expensive than conventional electricity. As of 2011, the technology produced less than one tenth of one percent of global energy demand. This method is able to concentrate sunlight as much as 1,500 times what would normally be possible from direct sunlight.</p>
