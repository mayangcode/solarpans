    <h6>Solar has been cheaper than coal everywhere on the planet for a long time now.</h6>
    <br>
    <p>Domestically, the market is projected to grow 25 percent to 50 percent this year and global projections are at 30 percent. Residential solar power systems that generate solar electricity can be making your home more energy efficient is the first step to getting cheap solar power. Setting up is easy and cheap. Solar has been cheaper than coal everywhere on the planet for a long time now. Political awareness put solar companies back in the spotlight and there is a lot of runway left. The oldest uses of solar energy is for heating, cooking, and drying. The decreasing solar price trend is your friend: The cost of solar and wind power has been declining rapidly in recent years. Solar energy is cheap compared to the high costs of fossil fuels and the toll they take on the environment. Solar power can be regarded as renewable energy source. We recently saw the international energy agency (iea) report that solar power offers the cheapest electricity in history. Historically, solar energy harvesting has been expensive and relatively inefficient. It has been used for thousands of years in many different ways by people all over the world.</p>
    <p><u>Hydro is cheap on variable cost basis and when considered. It&#039;s just that we heavily subsidize coal and oil. Solar energy is cheap in the long run. Hydro is cheap on variable cost basis and when considered. Although solar energy currently only accounts for 0.4 percent of electricity generated in the us, solar energy production is expected to grow significantly over the decade ahead. For example mountain top removal is a pretty cheap way to mine cole coal but has horific environmental costs.</u></p>
