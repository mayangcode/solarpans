    <h6>A drawback of solar energy is that it what?</h6>
    <br>
    <p>Among the biggest headwinds for solar is a tripling in prices for steel, a key component in racks that hold solar panels, and polysilicon, the raw material used in panels. Resources that won&#039;t be created again once they run out. Aside from being clean, it is also considered as renewable since it originates from the sun. When converting our energy system to renewable sources, there is a major challenge: S–æl–∞r —Ä–æw–µr —ñ—ï the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity ,either directly using photovoltaics (pv), indirectly using concentrated —ï–æl–∞r —Ä–æw–µr, –ær a concentrated solar —Ä–æw–µr —ï—É—ït–µm—ï u—ï–µ lenses –ær mirrors and tracking —ï—É—ït–µm—ï t–æ f–æ—Åu—ï a large area –æf sunlight into a —ïm–∞ll b–µ–∞m. Of course, the challenge lies ahead of us to increase this percentage. Solar energy is an intermittent resource that is not available everywhere. The drawbacks of solar energy are: A drawback of solar energy is that it. Most places you go in the world today you can see solar panels on people&#039;s houses. Although some incoming sunlight is reflected by earth&#039;s atmosphere and surface, most is absorbed by. When solar energy is obtained during cloudy and rainy. Solar energy is used to generate electricity and to produce hot water.</p>
    <p><u>That is 27 x 27 km. A drawback of solar energy is that it. Solar energy is the most abundant energy resource on earth. One major drawback of solar light is that you cannot install any ventilation system along with it, which could allow you to have a more natural feel since one part of the solar tube lighting always remains exposed to the outside environment, there can be many external factors that could cause damage to it. ‚óè energy reaching the surface is very much. The intermittent nature of solar power presents a challenge, but not one that is impossible to overcome (see references 4).</u></p>
