              <p><strong>Aesthetic Why Solar Energy Is Expensive</strong>. If solar panels and wind turbines became so much cheaper, why did the price of electricity rise instead of decline? It is still a bit more expensive than wind energy, but it&#039;s getting why does solar energy cost so much if it is the best option? Why are solar panels so expensive? One hypothesis might be that while electricity from solar and wind became cheaper, other energy sources like coal, nuclear, and natural gas became more expensive. Solar tracking systems are the most expensive option. The solar industry now operates in australia with relative small government rebate incentives.</p>
