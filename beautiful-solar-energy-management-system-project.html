    <h6>First of all, solar energy projects management, renewable energy in general, have a wide global interest in modern electrical networks.</h6>
    <br>
    <p>Storage devices with forecasts of solar power production and load. It is a renewable energy that is gaining momentum in the parts of the world because it is deemed as an effective alternative to the environmentally unfriendly fossil fuels. In this solar panel energy measurement project, you will get an idea how to measure solar energy using different sensors and pic microcontroller. This project proposes an iot based solar panel. Factors such as the local solar irradiation value, the structural with your own solar power, you protect yourself against rising energy costs and benefit from the solar systems are exposed to a wide variety of environmental influences during their service life. There are many numbers to calculate with respects to solar systems, but the main one that matters is payback time. Enact&#039; platform successfully digitizes the entire solar project design and net metering approval process for our service territory. Solar projects are making it easier for americans to choose solar energy to power their homes. Through the solar peis rod, the blm established a comprehensive solar energy program that allows the permitting of future solar energy development projects on public lands to proceed in a more efficient, standardized, and environmentally responsible manner. With the combined capacity from three separate locations at 354 megawatt (mw), it is the world&#039;s second largest solar thermal energy generating facility. Some utilities pay generous rates for solar power, some pay about the same as it costs to buy, and some pay little or nothing. So this course aims to make the participant aware of the solar energy systems. This system shows an efficient way of utilising the solar power solar panel dual management system:</p>
