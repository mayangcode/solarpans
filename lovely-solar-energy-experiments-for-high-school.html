You can use experiments to show kids how energy works. Solar arrays at colleges helps drive solar power forward. Energy measurements are emphasized and techniques for collector efficiency determinations are considered. Solar panel experiment using fresnel lens! Harness the power of the sun and convert it into usable energy! Solar energy explorations consists of eight solar energy experiments and one project for students to study renewable energy and solar power while practicing engineering design. Students calculate the amount of solar energy available at a given location and time of day on earth.
