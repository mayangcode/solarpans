In 2008, solar electric power amounted to a mere 0.2% of global energy produced but it is at a tipping point with a growth rate of 40% per year. When the system is actively supplying thermal energy to the building, the temperature rises in the summer months to a peak of about 80 c and falls in the winter months to a low of about 67 c. Solar energy welcomes manuscripts presenting information not previously published in journals on any aspect of solar energy research, development, application, measurement or submitted manuscripts may take the form of reports of original studies or reviews of significant prior work in a given area. Solar energy is the technology used to harness the sun&#039;s energy and make it useable. The addressed learning outcomes are analyzed based on the 13 learning outcomes defined by the accreditation board for.
