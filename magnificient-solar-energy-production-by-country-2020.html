Iea, renewable energy market update. At the end of 2011. The solar power or solar energy industry has been a focal point of huge investments in the form of r&amp;d &amp; innovation, towards higher power generation what started as an experimental form of energy production by bell labs in 1954, solar pv technology today is all set to transform the world&#039;s energy. Solar generation varies by state. Wind retakes the lead from solar. In our core economic transition scenario, global carbon emissions from energy use drop 8% in 2020 and now appear to have peaked in 2019. Solar, wind, hydropower, and other renewable energy sources currently account for a small share of global energy. By 2030, singapore wants to ramp up its solar capacity by more than seven times from current levels. On the strength of its continuous technological innovation.
